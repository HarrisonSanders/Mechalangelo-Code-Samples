# Mechalangelo-Code-Samples
Code Samples from Mechalangelo, a Unity + Steam VR asymmetrical multiplayer game.
All scripts are my own design, unless otherwise noted in a comment.

The bulk of my scripting work on Mechalangelo included:
- A controller and shooter controls for a 3rd-person spaceship
- Powerup functionality
- Spawner systems

Additionally, I did Sound and Technical Design. More information on the project: http://harrisonsanders.com/portfolio
